     A.  STATION METADATA FILE

     The station metadata are archived by station sort (region
     number, country code, WMO station number, national
     identification number).  Some stations do not have a WMO
     station number.  A pseudo-WMO station number was assigned to
     these stations and generally consists of 000 in the right-
     most three positions of the five-digit WMO station number,
     and these stations also have a national identification
     number either assigned by the submitting country or assigned
     by the NCDC.  Some stations do not have a national
     identification number.  Each station is uniquely identified
     by its [region number-country code-WMO station number-
     national identification number] aggregate information.

     The station metadata consists of information that identifies
     the station and includes:  WMO region number; WMO
     international index number; location information (latitude,
     longitude, elevation) and station name as provided by the
     WMO Member; location information and station name as
     published in the May 1996 WMO Publication No. 9, Vol. A-
     Stations (for those stations with a WMO international index
     number); country code and name; and station name as it
     appears in the 1961-1990 WMO Global Standard Normals
     publication (for the published stations).  The amount of
     metadata that was provided varied greatly from Member to
     Member.  Some Members provided complete metadata, some
     provided limited metadata (with the NCDC identifying the
     remaining metadata from other sources), and some provided no
     metadata (other than WMO station number or only station
     name).  In a few cases (less than a dozen stations), the
     station is identified by only an international index station
     number which could not be located in the WMO Publication No.
     9, Vol. A-Stations.

     Each station metadata record has the following record format
     (a blank-filled field indicates the information was not
     provided or is not available, or is not applicable for the
     station):
